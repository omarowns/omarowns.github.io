  "body": "> **tl;dr**   Web Developer and Software Engineer for web applications and client side software, also with some server architecture/administration notions and could step in if needed\r\n\r\nSo this is [me](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ODcbehpHfWY/U4LNQo-4TzI/AAAAAAAAACo/NLm4hClkd2g/w590-h589-no/selfie_3.jpg). **24 years old**, **Mexican** by birth, Viking by popular election (whaaaaat?), currently residing in **Aguascalientes, Mexico**. Beautiful sunsets, a sleeping giant type of mountain<sup>[1](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_del_Muerto)</sup> and the home of the biggest bar and party in the World!<sup>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feria_Nacional_de_San_Marcos)</sup> (At least LATAM)\r\n\r\nI love long walks, pizza and beer and tacos is a must in my diet.\r\n\r\nI currently work @ **MagmaLabs** as a **software engineer**. I do both front-end and back-end development and my current tools of trade are `ruby`, `ruby on rails`, `Javascript`, `AngularJS`.\r\n\r\nI also do some freelancing and entrepreneurship stuff and like to work on personal/private projects, mostly involving `ruby`, `ruby on rails` and `javascript`.\r\n\r\nI've participated on `Start-up Weekend` events both as attendee and as coach. I've given small workshops about 'Git' and 'Ruby on Rails' and planning on doing more workshops this year and hopefully give a conference at my __alma mater__ by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nPast employers are:\r\n* Grupo Dicotech, as a Web Developer/Software Engineer\r\n* Crowd Interactive, as a Web Developer (`ruby` ftw!)\r\n* Softtek, as an Information Security Engineer (trainee)\r\n* Grupo Sinco (you read that right, not _cinco_ but **_sinco_**), as a half-time developer and sysadmin.\r\nI also did freelancing for a U.S. startup for like two months while I transitioned from Softtek to Crowd Interactive\r\n\r\n\r\n### Experience\r\n\r\nI have my fair share of experience in `ruby`, `ruby on rails`, `javascript`, `angular`, `PHP` and `laravel`. Also have experience on `bootstrap` and responsive design. I also use libraries and tools like `jQuery`, `grunt`/`gulp`, `satellizer` and `socket-io`\r\n\r\nI love to apply `TDD` whenever I can > Red, Green, Refactor!\r\n\r\nStrong supporter of the `agile` software development, `XP` and `Scrum` is what I know the most\r\n\r\nAlso have some experience with `Java`, `C#`, `python` and `Objective-C`\r\n\r\nI have worked with both Linux and Windows servers. You know, setting them up, configure them properly, constantly monitoring them, installing application servers, databases, configuring scripts and that type of stuff. I'd say I had my fair experience with servers, routers, switches, access points and load balancers\r\n\r\n> Some of my work is on [github](http://www.github.com/omarowns), some of it is college related stuff\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can get in touch with me at [isc.omargarcia@gmail.com](mailto:isc.omargarcia@gmail.com) or [omar.garcia@magmalabs.io](mailto:omar.garcia@magmalabs.io)\r\n\r\n### Social media stuff (?)\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](mx.linkedin.com/in/omargarciaperez)\r\n\r\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/omarowns)\r\n\r\n[Snapchat]()\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarowns)",
