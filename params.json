{"name":"Omar Garcia","tagline":"Eres mas valiente que Brodo","body":"> **tl;dr**   Web Developer and Software Engineer for web applications and client side software, also with some server architecture/administration notions and could step in if needed\r\n\r\nSo this is [me](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ODcbehpHfWY/U4LNQo-4TzI/AAAAAAAAACo/NLm4hClkd2g/w590-h589-no/selfie_3.jpg). **23 years old**, **Mexican** by birth, Viking by popular election (whaaaaat?), currently residing in **Aguascalientes, Mexico**. Beautiful sunsets, a sleeping giant type of mountain<sup>[1](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_del_Muerto)</sup> and the home of the biggest bar and party in the World!<sup>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feria_Nacional_de_San_Marcos)</sup> (At least LATAM)\r\n\r\nI love long walks, pizza and beer and tacos is a must in my diet, [Destiny](https://www.bungie.net/) is my preferred game at this moment\r\n\r\nI currently work @ **Grupo Dicotech** as a **web developer**. I give support to their webpage and their internal CMS and POS, both backend and frontend. Currently working with `PHP`\r\n\r\nI also do some freelancing and like to work on personal/private projects, mostly involving `ruby`, `ruby on rails`, `javascript` and sometimes `iOS`\r\n\r\nPast employers are:\r\n* Crowd Interactive, as a Web Developer (`ruby` ftw!)\r\n* Softtek, as an Information Security Engineer (trainee)\r\n* Grupo Sinco (you read that right, not _cinco_ but **_sinco_**), as a half-time developer and sysadmin.\r\nI also did freelancing for like two months while I transitioned from Softtek to Crowd Interactive\r\n\r\n\r\n### Experience\r\n\r\nWell... does omarexperience counts? Kidding he he he...\r\n\r\nMainly `ruby`, `ruby on rails` and `javascript` but quickly getting in shape using frameworks like `angular`, `backbone`, `bootstrap` and libraries like `jQuery`\r\n\r\nCurrently, as I said earlier, `PHP` and `MySQL`\r\n\r\nI love to apply `TDD` whenever I can > Red, Green, Refactor!\r\n\r\nStrong supporter of the `agile` software development, `XP` and `Scrum` is what I know the most\r\n\r\nAlso have some experience with `Java`, `C#`, `python` and `Objective-C`\r\n\r\nI have worked with both Linux and Windows servers. You know, setting them up, configure them properly, constantly monitoring them, installing application servers, databases, configuring scripts and that type of stuff. I'd say I had my fair experience with servers, routers, switches, access points and load balancers\r\n\r\n> Some of my work is on [github](http://www.github.com/omarowns), but mostly is college related stuff, the cool stuff is private due to the organisations I've worked with\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can get in touch with me at [isc.omargarcia@gmail.com](mailto:isc.omargarcia@gmail.com) or [ogarcia@zegucom.com.mx](mailto:ogarcia@zegucom.com.mx)","google":"UA-60698230-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
