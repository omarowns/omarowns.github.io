> **tl;dr** Software Engineer ü§ò mainly `Ruby` and `Ruby on Rails` ‚ô¶Ô∏è

So this is [me](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1001797). **25 years old**, **Mexican** by birth, Viking by popular election (whaaaaat?), currently residing in **Guadalajara, Mexico**. Delicious food, great night life and one of the biggest tech cities in Mexico. Originally from **Aguascalientes, Mexico** were the beautiful sunsets with a sleeping giant type of mountain<sup>[1](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_del_Muerto)</sup> will make you weep and the home of the biggest bar and party in the World!<sup>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feria_Nacional_de_San_Marcos)</sup> (At least LATAM)

I love long walks, pizza and beer and tacos is a must in my diet.

I currently work @ **MagmaLabs** as a **software engineer**. I do both front-end and back-end development and my current tools of trade are `ruby`, `ruby on rails`, `Javascript`, `React`.

I also do some freelancing and entrepreneurship stuff and like to work on personal/private projects, mostly involving `ruby`, `ruby on rails` and `javascript`.

I've participated on `StartUp Weekend` events both as attendee and as coach. I've given small workshops about `Git` and `Ruby on Rails`. On September 2016 I gave my fist conference at my __alma matter__ (Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes) with the title _A Developers Survival Guide: Best Practices for a Programmer_ targeted to Computer Sciences and Software Engineering students.

Past employers are:
* Grupo Dicotech, as a Web Developer/Software Engineer
* Crowd Interactive, as a Web Developer (`ruby` ftw!)
* AgencyMVP, as a Ruby On Rails Software Engineer/Contractor
* Softtek, as an Information Security Engineer (trainee)
* Grupo Sinco (you read that right, not _cinco_ but **_sinco_**), as a half-time developer and sysadmin.


### Experience

I have my fair share of experience in `ruby`, `ruby on rails`, `javascript`, `angular`, `PHP` and `laravel`. Also have experience on `bootstrap` and responsive design. I also use libraries and tools like `jQuery`, `grunt`/`gulp`, `satellizer` and `socket-io`

I love to apply `TDD` whenever I can > Red, Green, Refactor!

Strong supporter of the `agile` software development, `XP` and `Scrum` is what I know the most

Also have some experience with `Java`, `C#`, `python` and `Objective-C`

I have worked with both Linux and Windows servers. You know, setting them up, configure them properly, constantly monitoring them, installing application servers, databases, configuring scripts and that type of stuff. I'd say I had my fair experience with servers, routers, switches, access points and load balancers
