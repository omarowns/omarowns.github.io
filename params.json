I give support to their webpage and their internal CMS and POS, both backend and frontend. Currently working with `PHP`, `Laravel`, `Angular.js` and `Javascript`.\r\n\r\nI also do some freelancing and like to work on personal/private projects, mostly involving `ruby`, `ruby on rails` and `javascript`.\r\n\r\nPast employers are:\r\n* Crowd Interactive, as a Web Developer (`ruby` ftw!)\r\n* Softtek, as an Information Security Engineer (trainee)\r\n* Grupo Sinco (you read that right, not _cinco_ but **_sinco_**), as a half-time developer and sysadmin.\r\nI also did freelancing for a U.S. startup for like two months while I transitioned from Softtek to Crowd Interactive\r\n\r\n\r\n### Experience\r\n\r\nI have my fair share of experience in `ruby`, `ruby on rails`, `javascript`, `angular`, `PHP` and `laravel`.
